# 2025-Sparkhacks-Project
For the UIC Sparkhacks hackathon. All work for the project will be done here.

Notes to Team:
- Let me know who to add as collaborators
- We can discuss roles at the hackathon or in person.
- Each person can work on a section at a time, or review work done by others.
  Ex: front end developer working on the aesthetics of a website like html and CSS, another working and a backend developer working on server side parts.

Let me know if there is anything I should add. Go team!
